    "# Predicting County-Level Acute Food Insecurity in Kenya Using Climate, Market, and Conflict Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict which Kenyan counties are likely to experience **acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse)** in upcoming months. Current assessments coordinated under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) primarily describe past conditions, making humanitarian response reactive rather than preventive.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining IPC outcomes with rainfall, staple food prices, and conflict events, this project develops a simple **county-level early warning model**. The work supports humanitarian analytics and public policy, targeting NGOs, county governments, and food security planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "If operationalized, this system could improve early targeting of interventions and resource allocation, aligning with analytical frameworks used by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- World Food Programme (WFP)  \n",
    "- Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  \n",
    "- Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a county-level predictive model that estimates the probability of entering **IPC Phase 3+** one month ahead using climate, market, and conflict indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a clean county–month panel dataset integrating multiple data sources.\n",
    "- Identify the most important drivers of acute food insecurity.\n",
    "- Compare performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.\n",
    "- Develop a simple prototype dashboard for visualizing predicted risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Food insecurity monitoring in Kenya largely describes historical conditions using descriptive statistics and post-hoc analysis. There is currently no simple, data-driven system that predicts which counties are likely to enter IPC Phase 3+ in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Humanitarian response is reactive.\n",
    "- Resources are allocated after crisis onset.\n",
    "- Early warning signals from climate variability, food price shocks, and instability are not fully integrated into predictive systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to address this gap by developing a short-term, county-level classification model for IPC Phase 3+ risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The project integrates four open-access datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 IPC Classifications (Target Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "- County-level IPC phases  \n",
    "- Quarterly validity periods (expanded to monthly)  \n",
    "- Binary target defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    1 = IPC Phase ≥ 3\n",
    "    0 = IPC Phase ≤ 2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Rainfall Data (Climate Driver)\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly county-level rainfall indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rfh` – Monthly rainfall anomaly ratio  \n",
    "- `r3h` – 3-month cumulative rainfall  \n",
    "\n",
    "These variables capture short-term rainfall shock and seasonal drought stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Food Prices (Market Driver)\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly maize retail prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- County-level monthly average price  \n",
    "- Monthly percent change  \n",
    "\n",
    "Maize is selected as Kenya’s primary staple food.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Conflict Events (Instability Driver)\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly county-level conflict event counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable captures local instability that may disrupt markets, livelihoods, and food access.\n",
    "\n",
